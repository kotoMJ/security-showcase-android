  # Security Showcase is not under further maintenance anymore!
 
 
  ## âš  Few reasons to quit:
  - project mix KeystoreCompatLibrary with some security related samples, which is not maintenable from the long therm perspecitve
  - KeystoreCompatLibrary has it's meaning just for API 19 & API 21, it's not meaningful for newer versions - and the cost for maintanence and enhancement is high when compared with the scope.
  - KeystoreCompatLibrary has no place on android since BiometricPrompt in AndroidX
  - SecurityShowcase samples are obsolete and mixed together, they should be available in more convenient way.
  
  
  **I will personally think about better scoped project also with security topic, but better scalable, up to date and worth for Android world.**
